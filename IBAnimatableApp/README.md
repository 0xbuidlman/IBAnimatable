# IBAnimatable Playground
**IBAnimatable Playground** is a playground to see the features IBAnimatable can support for prototyping and designing UI, animations, transitions and interactions. You can find your prefer effects and apply them in Interface Builder. 

This `code` folder is not mandatary for the demo App. **The app was made in Interface Builder with `IBAnimatable` without a single line of code**. 

Because we want to demostrate more effects (e.g. animations, transitions) with one Scene within Interface Builder. In most of Apps, we usually apply one effect to one View or Scene, then we can configurate that effect in Interface Builder without any code.
