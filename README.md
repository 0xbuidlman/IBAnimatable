# IBAnimatable
IBAnimatable helps designers and developers design UI, navigations, interactions and animations in Interface Builder.

As a designer, we love Sketch, which is simple but yet super powerful tool to design UI. But Sketch doesn't support navigations, interactions and animations, we may need another tool like Framer to design them. Also, to make a shippable App, we need to use Xcode and Interface Builder to redo the UI and animations. To smooth the process and minimise the waste, we create `IBAnimatable` to make Interface Builder designable and animatable.
